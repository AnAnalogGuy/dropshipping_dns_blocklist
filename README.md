How to use the list as DNS blocklist in unbound dns/opnsense?
- Go to blocklists
- Select "advanced mode"
- In the field "URLs of Blocklists" add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AnAnalogGuy/dropshipping_dns_blocklist/refs/heads/main/dropshipping_dns_blocklist_ch
- Press the "Save button". The blocklists will be downloaded and applied.
- In the logfiles you should see the list has been downloaded and a little less than 300 entries have been added to the blacklist
- Open a browser tab and add one of the URLs to check if your DNS server does resolve it. If you end with a "not found" error, the blocklist has worked as intended.
